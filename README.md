# PythonBlockchain

This is a simple blockchain for digital rights management made from approximately 300 lines of Python code. This code was created as a proof of concept for using blockchain for digital rights management. The code is not a business solution and is only for educational purposes.

# Project Introduction/Description

As technology continues to disrupt and redefine industry and society, “practical technical knowledge needs to be integrated into many fields of education.”[^1] The legal field is no different. Lawyers in their roles as trusted advisors for clients, interpreters for experts, and translators for judges will be required to understand the underpinnings of technology at a basic level. The areas requiring these tech-savvy attorneys are vast -- “Network neutrality, privacy, government surveillance, self-driving cars, medical implants, Internet governance, cloud computing liability, ‘patent trolls,’ copyright and new media models, and algorithmic marketing, just to name a few.”[^2]

One way to broaden this area of understanding is to gain proficiency in basic coding. Law schools and firms have begun to see the importance of this type of training as useful not only for lawyers specializing in technologies like blockchain, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence, but to ensure that on a more basic level all lawyers have a basic foundation in computational logic.[^3]  Hence, the intention behind Legal Chain curriculum is less about creating a new industry of lawyers moonlighting as software developers than it is to better equip lawyers to understand the “new opportunities that technology creates, [and to] think about the new issues (practical and ethical) that such technologies create.”[^4]

Specifically, a proficiency in blockchain theories and concepts is becoming more and more essential for lawyers to provide competent representation for their clients. Blockchain has positioned itself as the future of digital contracts and transactions, and the records of those interactions. To quote ipwatchdog.com, “To understand blockchain technology as a potential solution to problems posed ... one must first understand what the technology is and how it operates.”[^5] 

What we have provided here is a hands-on approach to learning the fundamentals of blockchain technology and coding. Participants will acquire a foundation for understanding core blockchain concepts like ledgers, immutability, hashing and coding fundamentals like functions, programming logic, and loops. This curriculum is meant to law students and practitioners how to build a proof of concept blockchain in approximately 300 lines of Python code. 

By building a proof of concept blockchain, students and legal practitioners will be better positioned to engage with their future clients and the legal issues of tomorrow.
